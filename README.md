We were supposed to make a calculator with some fancy function. What i have tried to do is to make the calculator save the addition history.

My Approach - I tried to make a string of the outputs of the add function ( which were offcourse integers ) by typecasting ( explicit ) and then save it with store function as well as produce it after compilation by get retreive. 

But unfortunately it doesn't work  ( the attached code throws errors, which i couldn't debug ).

This task gave me a good ground reality check that there is alot i have to got to do. Couldn't do it perfectly but still learned quite a lot :)

Atlast i would say i am not quite sure whether what i did makes me deserving to be a part of gdsc team. But i would love to join and learn more.  

Thanks to the GDSC team for the task!
