We were supposed to make a calculator with some fancy function. What i have tried to do is to make the calculator save the addition history.

My Approach - I tried to make a string of the outputs of the add function ( which were offcourse integers ) by typecasting ( explicit ) and then save it with store function as well as produce it after compilation by get retreive. 

But unfortunately it doesn't work  ( the attached code throws errors, which i couldn't debug ).

This task gave me a good ground reality check that there is alot i have to got to do. 

Thanks to the GDSC team for the task!
